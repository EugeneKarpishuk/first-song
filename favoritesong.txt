To be more than a conqueror
You have to learn to enjoy the pain
If you want to survive the game

You can try to defeat me (Defeat me)
You don't know it's the pain that'll feed me
(Feed me)
And I'm gonna take back what you took before (Before)
'Cause I was born for this
All the bones that you're breakin' (Breakin')
You pretend that you're the one that can save me
(Save me)
Now I'm takin' it back, it was never yours
(Never yours)
I'm fightin'

Fightin' for my focus
Give the pain a purpose
Light the fire inside
Feel it come alive (Come alive)
Show 'em what I'm made of
Victory's for the brave ones
Who never bow the knee
When it's do or die (Do or die-ie-ie)
One more time

Survivin' the game
